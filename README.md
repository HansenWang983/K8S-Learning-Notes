# Kubernetes 

This repository mainly contains the xmind map and markdown notes while I am studying the Kubernetes.

I will first explore the basic concepts of Kubernetes system, including [Cluster Architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/), [Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/), [Services, Load Balancing, and Networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/), and etc.

Then, I will dive deeper into understandings of how Kubernetes works, by grasping the core ideas of algorithms in automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications behind some production-level systems.

Finally, I will setup a cluster and walkthrough the basics with the hand-on examples.
